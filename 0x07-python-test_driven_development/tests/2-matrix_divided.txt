How to use 2-matrix_divided.py
==============================

This module defines a function to divide a matrix ``matrix_divided(matrix, div)``.

Usage
=====

``matrix_divided(matrix, div)`` returns a new matrix copy of the OG ``matrix``
with all elements divided by ``div``.

::

	>>> matrix_divided = __import__('2-matrix_divided').matrix_divided
	>>> matrix = [
	...	[4, 8, 12],
	...	[16, 20, 24]
	... ]
	>>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 4))
	[[1.0, 2.0, 3.0], [4.0, 5.0, 6.0]]

Quotients are rounded to max 2 decimal places.

::

	>>> matrix = [
	...     [1, 2, 3],
	...     [4, 5, 6]
	... ]
	>>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 3))
	[[0.33, 0.67, 1.0], [1.33, 1.67, 2.0]]

The original matrix passed as an argument is untouched.

::

	>>> print(matrix)
	[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]

Floats can also be passed as matrix indices

::

	>>> matrix = [
	...	[1.1, -2.2, 3.3],
	...	[4.4, 5.5, -6.6]
	... ]
	>>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 3))
	[[0.37, -0.73, 1.1], [1.47, 1.83, -2.2]]

Ints and float indices can also be used

::

	>>> matrix = [
	...     [1, -2.2, 3, 4.4, 5],
	...     [-6.6, 7.00, 8, 9.999, 10]
	... ]
	>>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 3))
	[[0.33, -0.73, 1.0, 1.47, 1.67], [-2.2, 2.33, 2.67, 3.33, 3.33]]

Invalid Matrices
================

The parameter ``matrix`` must be a list of lists consisting of either ints or
floats. If ``matrix`` is not a list, a TypeError is raised.

::

    >>> matrix = "not a list"
    >>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 3))
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    TypeError: matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats

::

    >>> matrix = None
    >>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 3))
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    TypeError: matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats

Note that an empty list will raise the TypeError.

::

    >>> matrix = []
    >>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 3))
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    TypeError: matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats

An empty list of lists passes.

::

    >>> matrix = [[]]
    >>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 3))
    [[]]

Typeerror is raised if ``matrix`` isn't a list of lists.

::

    >>> matrix = [1, 2, 3]
    >>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 3))
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    TypeError: matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats

Typeerror is raised if any indices are not an int or float.

::

    >>> matrix = [
    ...     [1, 2, 3],
    ...     [4, "sth else", 6]
    ... ]
    >>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 3))
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    TypeError: matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats


All rows in ``matrix`` must be the same size. Otherwise, a TypeError is raised

::

    >>> matrix = [
    ...     [1, 2, 3, 4],
    ...     [5, 6, 7]
    ... ]
    >>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 3))
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    TypeError: Each row of the matrix must have the same size

Invalid Divisors
================

The parameter ``div`` must be either an int or float. Otherwise, a TypeError
is raised.

::

    >>> matrix = [
    ...     [1, 2, 3],
    ...     [4, 5, 6]
    ... ]
    >>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, "not a number"))
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    TypeError: div must be a number

::

    >>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, None))
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    TypeError: div must be a number

``div`` must be non-zero. Otherwise, a ZeroDivisionError is raised.

::

    >>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 0))
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ZeroDivisionError: division by zero
